## Tech
- **Drone simulation:** physics-based motion with acceleration and deceleration
- **LiDAR simulation:** raycast sweeps generating configurable point clouds
- **Voxel mapping:** scalable grid-based occupancy stored in chunks of byte arrays
- **3D DDA:** voxel traversal algorithm used in line of sight checks and marking free cells along each ray
- **Frontier detection & goal management:** identifies unknown boundaries and manages exploration targets
- **Hybrid pathfinding:** weighted Theta* with jump point extension over voxels and A* over waypoints, followed by line-of-sight path smoothing
- **Dynamic waypoint graph:** line-of-sight connectivity with auto-bridging for scalability
- **GPU-instanced visualization:** efficient rendering of voxels, waypoints, frontiers, and paths

## Quick Setup
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in **Unity 6 (tested on 6000.0.0f1, URP)**
3. Open the small demo scene at `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene`
4. *(Optional)* Experiment with your own scenes and adjust the droneâ€™s component variables (see tooltips)
